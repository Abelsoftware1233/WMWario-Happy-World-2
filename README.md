## Features
### OOP Design
Incorporated Object oriented programming principles to create fun and interactive world where objects have different interactions with Mario. Everything is class based, so all moving objects inherit from the base class of "GameObject". Any unique behaviors get implemented in the specific objects that they belong to. For example, the Koopa class is very unique since it is the only object that turns into a lethal shell when Mario stomps on it.
